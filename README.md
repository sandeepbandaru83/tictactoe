 The code should be saved as tic_tac_toe.py.

 Launch a command prompt or terminal.

 Go to the directory where the file is located.

 Use the Python file tic_tac_toe.py to launch the game.
 The board has the following numbers, ranging from 0 to 8:


 -------------| 0 | 1 | 2 |
 -------------| 3 | 4 | 5 |
 -------------|6 | 7 | 8 |

 Players alternately enter a number between 0 and 8 to insert their mark (X or O) in the appropriate cell.
 Players take turns entering a number (0-8) to place their mark (X or O) in the corresponding cell

The game ends when:

A player gets 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

All cells are filled (draw)
